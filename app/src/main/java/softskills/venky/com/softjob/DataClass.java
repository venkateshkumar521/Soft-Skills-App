It involves the distribution of messages clearly and concisely, in a way that connects with the audience. \n" +

                "The Top 10 Communication Skills for Graduates..........\n" +
                "\t1). Emotional Intelligence:\n" +
                "Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your emotions so as to communicate effectively, avoid stress, overcome challenges and empathise with others. It’s a skill which is learned over time rather than obtained.There are four main strands to emotional intelligence: self awareness, self management, social awareness and relationship management. Each of these strands is important in its own way and allows you to communicate confidently with a variety of people.\n" +
                "\t2).Cohesion and Clarity:\n" +
                " Good communication is much more than saying the right thing; it is about communicating messages clearly and concisely. Before you start a conversation, type an email or begin a discussion, have in mind what the purpose of the communication is and what information you hope to obtain as a result. Lack of clarity and cohesion can result in poor decisions and confusion.\n" +
                "\t3). Friendliness:\n" +
                "  In any type of communication, make sure that you set the right tone. A friendly tone will encourage others to communicate with you. Always try to personalise messages, particularly when working with partners or fellow colleagues. Wishing the recipient a good weekend, for example, is a great way to personalise your message.\n" +
                "\t4). Confidence:\n" +
                "  In all interactions, confidence (but not over-confidence) is crucial. Demonstrating confidence will give customers faith in your abilities to deliver what they need, and that you will follow through with what you have promised.\n" +
                "Conveying confidence can be something as simple as maintaining eye contact during a conversation, or using a firm but friendly tone when speaking with people over the phone. Be careful not to come across as aggressive, since this will have the opposite effect of what you are hoping to achieve.\n" +
                "\t5). Empathy:\n" +
                "  Within a busy work environment, everyone will have their own ideas about how things should be done. Even if you have disagreements with your colleagues or partners, their point of view should be considered and respected.\n" +
                "Empathy is also beneficial when speaking with customers in certain types of customer-facing role. The goal here is to understand where the other person is coming from - and respect their views even if they are very different from your own.\n" +
                "\t6). Respect:\n" +
                "  Empathy leads into the next communication skill, respect. If you respect the ideas and opinions of others, they will be more likely to communicate with you. Active listening or simply using the name of the person you are speaking to can both be effective. Make sure that when you type emails, you don’t sound insincere or write in a way that is insincere.\n" +
                "\t7). Listening:\n" +
                "  Good communication is all about listening effectively. Take the time to listen to what the other person is saying and practice active listening. Pay attention to what the other person is saying, ask questions and clarify points, and rephrase what they have said so that you know you have understood correctly.\n" +
                "\t8). Open Mindedness:\n" +
                "Try to enter into communications without having an agenda. Strong communications require an open mind and a commitment to understanding other people’s points of view. If you disagree with the people you are speaking to, try to reach a middle ground that benefits all parties. Approaching a discussion with an open mind is more likely to result in a successful outcome.\n" +
                "\t9). Tone of Voice:\n" +
                " The tone of your voice can set the whole mood of the conversation. If you start the discussion in an aggressive or unhelpful manner, the recipient will be more inclined to respond in a similar way. \n" +
                "The tone of your voice will include the level of emotion that you use, the volume you use and the level of communication you choose.The same sentence can have a very different meaning depending on which words are emphasised and the tone of your voice. \n" +
                "In a customer complaint scenario, for example, your tone of voice should be as calm as possible, since an unfriendly tone of voice will only serve to worsen the situation.\n" +
                "\t10). Asking Good Questions:\n" +
                "  Good questions can help conversations flow and improve the outcome. During a conversation, always aim to ask open-ended questions. These are questions with prompts which encourage the recipient to speak about certain points and they require more detailed responses.\n" +
                "If you need further information still, you can use probing questions which request even more information from the recipient such as ‘Tell me the process of…” During the conversation include a mixture of questions including clarification, ‘what if’ scenarios and open-ended questions to make sure that you achieve what you set out to do at the beginning of the call or conversation.\n" +

                "Decision making is a core skill that every employee will need to use at some stage in their career." +
                " To prove you are good at decision making, you will need to make the best possible choice in the shortest " +
                "time possible, as well as being able to show reasons that support your decisions. Generally the more senior the " +
                "role, the more difficult these decisions become.\n" +
                "Many employees are forced to make complex decisions routinely as part of their job description; sometimes these " +
                "decisions have to be made under intense pressure. Therefore employers need to know that the people they recruit " +
                "can take the initiative when required and make good decisions in important situations.\n" +
                "In certain positions (eg management), decision making is a fundamental aspect of the role. Consequently " +
                "employers need to measure the capability of an individual to make informed decisions. Skills tests and " +
                "activities through an interview or assessment centre are a great way to achieve this. Of course, " +
                "decision making is not just confined to a managerial role; it relates to almost every job at every level. " +
                "Good decisions are a crucial element of day-to-day business.\n" +
                "Making complex decisions, under pressure, is a key skill in many jobs.\n" +
                "Why do Employers Value Decision Making Skills?\n" +
                "Employers tend to value decision making because it is a skill that is required in many different situations " +
                "across many business areas - " +
                "from everyday tasks through to more complex projects or unforeseen situations.\n" +
                "The more important decision making is as a skill for the job you have applied for, the more emphasis it " +
                "will be given by the employer during the application process. The technique that employers use to assess " +
                "decision making skills will vary depending on the activities and tests that they provide, but the majority of " +
                "them will be time-based, and candidates will be expected to explain the reasoning they used to reach their " +
                "decision.\n" +
                "The Decision Making Process\n" +
                "When decisions have to be made, there are several stages that you should go through to reach a practical solution:\n" +
                "Step 1: Identifying the problem, opportunity or challenge.\n" +
                "Step 2: Developing a set of potential responses or viable solutions.\n" +
                "Step 3: Evaluating the benefits and any associated costs with the implementation of each solution.\n" +
                "Step 4: Selecting the most suitable solution or response to address the issue.\n" +
                "Step 5: The implementation stage.\n" +
                "Step 6: Reviewing the impact of the decision and amending the course of action as required.\n" +
                "The above steps don’t work for every decision, but this is nevertheless a useful framework when it comes to " +
                "making tough operational decisions. If a decision has to be made quickly, you probably won’t have the luxury of " +
                "running through each of these steps.\n" +
                "Typical Decision-Making Questions\n" +
                "During the selection process, employers will want to assess a candidate’s decision-making skill by asking a " +
                "number of specific questions to determine their " +
                "level of expertise. Typical decision making questions could include:\n" +
                "•\tDescribe the most difficult decision that you had to make and why was it so difficult?\n" +
                "•\tProvide a situation when a decision you made affected others\n" +
                "•\tHow do you come to conclusions?\n" +

                "•\tDo you find making decisions difficult?\n" +
                "Candidates should answer these and similar questions using the STAR technique, examining the situation, task," +
                " action and result. Make sure that the situation that " +
                "you provide is both relevant and professional for the role that you are applying for. Ensure that your answers are " +
                "short, succinct and to the point. It may seem tempting " +
                "to drag on with your answers, but it will only bore an interviewer and potentially cost you the position.\n" +
                "The leadership style and the organisational culture will determine the specific process required for decision " +
                "making in a particular business. " +
                "Some organisations may adopt a consensus approach, while others will rely on management decisions. " +
                "The majority of businesses will combine centralised and census-based styles, and the way in which an employee " +
                "participates will be based on the organisatioal structure.\n" +
                "As you go through the usual preparatory work for your interview, it is important that you carefully review the " +
                "job description and thoroughly research the business so you " +
                "understand how your decision making skills will fit in with the wider business. " +
                "That way you can emphasise your skills more effectively both on your CV and during the interview.\n" +
                "Types of Decision Making\n" +
                "Generally speaking, there are three ways in which you can make a decision:\n" +
                "Intuition:\n" +
                "This is used to describe when you have a ‘gut feeling’ about something. This type of decision making is handy" +
                " when you have to make a decision quickly, or you have a considerable amount of experience that enables you to " +
                "make a snap judgment of the situation.\n" +
                "Logic:\n" +
                "In comparison to intuition, logic requires the person to come to an informed choice based on all the facts" +
                " presented to them. Before making a decision, that person will have been presented with large amounts of information " +
                "surrounding it, and it will be their job to decide which is the most suitable decision based on all of the disadvantages " +
                "and advantages of the options that they have available to them. The ability to use logical reasoning is especially useful" +
                " within certain types of employment, such as the legal sector and consulting.\n" +
                "Cognitive Bias:\n" +
                "Inherent bias can both disrupt and distort the decision-making process. " +
                "The most common cognitive biases include confirmation, anchoring, the halo effect and over-confidence.\n" +
                "•\tConfirmation is when a decision maker will seek out evidence that confirms their previously held belief, while discounting any evidence in support of other conclusions.\n" +
                "•\tAnchoring is over-reliance on a single piece of evidence or experience to reach certain judgements.\n" +
                "•\tThe halo effect is an overall impression of a company, individual, brand or product which has a direct " +
                "impact on an individual’s feelings and thoughts.\n" +
                "•\tOver-confidence occurs when someone overestimates how reliable their judgements are.\n" +
                "Which Factors Can Lead to Poor Decision Making?\n" +
                "There are a number of factors that can negatively impact decision making, including:\n" +
                "•\tInadequate information. If you do not have sufficient information, decisions can be made without considering all " +
                "of the facts. Take time to collect the necessary data even if you have a particularly short timescale.\n" +
                "•\tInformation overload. Too much information than you know how to handle can also prove detrimental to the" +
                " decision-making process. This can be overcome by a department or team coming together and deciding what" +
                " information is the most important and the reasons for this.\n" +
                "•\tToo many people. Reaching a decision by committee can be difficult, as everyone has their own views and values." +
                " Although it is important to take these into consideration, it’s usually best to designate someone to make a decision.\n" +
                "•\tVested interest. If any of the decision makers has an incentive to reach one particular result, a fair decision-making " +
                "process could be compromised.\n" +
                "•\tResistance to change. People are often attached to a business - particularly those in the management team - and for " +
                "some the prospect of change can be difficult.\n" +
                "•\tNo attachment. On the other hand, some decisions cannot be made because the decision maker doesn’t mind one way or " +
